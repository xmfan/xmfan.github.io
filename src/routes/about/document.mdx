# About Me

I recently graduated from the University of Waterloo, where I spent most of my
time leading our autonomous vehicles team, staying involved in the Data Science
community, organizing useless hack hackathons and doing several internships.
I currently work on conversational reasoning at Facebook.

I am driven mostly by general curiosity. This website is where I choose to publish
some of my more structured shower thoughts.
